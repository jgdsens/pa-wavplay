Play and record multi-channel audio in Matlab.

This project is a modification of one previously developed by Matt Frear and posted 
on both Source Forge and the Mathworks File Exchange.

The original code:

- played multi-channel audion from Matlab using ASIO, DirectSound, and Windows Audio.
- worked with 32-bit installations of Matlab only on Windows.

This update extends the original to:

- play multi-channel audio from Matlab using ASIO, WASAPI, DirectSound, and Windows Audio.
- works with both 32-bit and 64-bit installations of Matlab on Windows.  

The code is built upon the open source PortAudio API.

Requirements: Windows Vista or later.
